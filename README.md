## Overview

This project analyzes NBA team patterns using unsupervised learning techniques. By examining team performance, player stats, and injuries, we discover natural team archetypes, track strategic evolution, and identify exceptional performances. The analysis provides insights into what drives success in the NBA.

## Data Sources

The following datasets were used in this project:
- [NBA Shots Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/nba-shots): Provides detailed information on shot locations and types.
- [NBA Injury Stats Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/loganlauton/nba-injury-stats-1951-2023): Includes historical injury data from 1951-2023.
- [NBA/ABA/BAA Team Statistics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumitrodatta/nba-aba-baa-stats): Contains team performance data, including regular season stats and advanced metrics.
