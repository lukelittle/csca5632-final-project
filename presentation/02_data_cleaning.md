# Making Sense of the Data

Let me walk you through what we discovered while cleaning up our NBA data. This was a fascinating process because we found so many interesting changes in how basketball has been recorded over the years.

When we first looked at our data, we found that teams were recorded in 45 different ways. The Phoenix Suns might be "PHO" in one dataset and "PHX" in another. The Oklahoma City Thunder used to be the Seattle SuperSonics. We had to standardize all of this to make sure we were tracking teams correctly through time.

The way basketball stats are recorded has changed dramatically too. Before 1979, there was no three-point line, so all those shots were just counted as field goals. The shot clock came in 1954, which completely changed how many possessions teams had per game. We had to account for all these changes to make fair comparisons across different eras.

One of our biggest discoveries was in the injury data. Modern injury reports are incredibly detailed - they tell us exactly what happened and how long a player was out. But as we went back in time, this information became less consistent. We had to carefully piece together how injuries affected teams in different eras.

The most exciting part was seeing how data collection in basketball has evolved. Today, we track everything - exactly where each shot was taken, how contested it was, what type of play led to it. But in the past, we might just have total shots and percentages. This really shows how the analysis of basketball has become more sophisticated over time.

We also found some amazing statistical outliers that we had to verify were real. When you see something like Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game in the data, it looks like an error because it's so far from normal - but that one was real! We had to carefully separate these incredible genuine performances from actual data errors.

After cleaning everything up, we reduced our missing data from 12% to less than 1%. More importantly, we now have a consistent way to compare teams across different eras. We can look at how the 1996 Bulls compare to the 2017 Warriors, even though they played in very different versions of the NBA.

This clean data is going to let us discover patterns we couldn't see before. We can now trace how basketball strategies have evolved, see how different styles of play developed, and understand what makes certain teams revolutionary. It's like having a time machine that lets us watch the entire history of the NBA with modern analytics.
