# How Basketball Has Changed

After finding these team patterns, we wanted to understand how basketball strategy has evolved over time. The changes we found tell an amazing story about how the game has transformed.

Let's start with shooting. In the 1990s, teams averaged about 13 three-point attempts per game. Today, that number has exploded to 34 attempts per game. That's not just a small change - it's a complete revolution in how basketball is played. Teams aren't just shooting more threes; they're building their entire strategy around them.

The pace of the game has changed too. In the early 1990s, teams averaged about 91 possessions per game. It dropped even lower in the mid-2000s as teams played more half-court basketball. But now we're seeing around 100 possessions per game - teams are playing faster and getting more shots up.

The way teams score has completely flipped:
- In the 1990s: 43% of shots were from mid-range, only 13% from three-point range
- Today: Only 14% from mid-range, while 34% are three-pointers
- Points in the paint have stayed surprisingly steady at around 45%

But it's not just about shooting. The whole concept of positions has changed:
- 1990s: Each position had a specific job (point guard passes, center rebounds)
- 2000s: Positions started blending together
- Today: "Positionless basketball" where everyone needs to do everything

We can see this in how teams are built:
- Traditional teams had one playmaker (the point guard)
- Modern teams often have 3-4 players who can run the offense
- Centers now need to shoot and pass, not just play near the basket

The numbers show how offense has taken over:
- 1990s: Average offensive rating around 95
- Early 2000s: Climbed to about 107
- Today: Teams are scoring 113 points per 100 possessions

What's fascinating is how these changes spread through the league:
1. One team tries something new (like the Warriors with three-point shooting)
2. If it works, other teams start copying it
3. Teams that don't adapt get left behind
4. Eventually, it becomes the new normal

We also found that these changes aren't random - they're driven by:
- Rule changes (like defensive three seconds)
- Analytics showing what strategies work best
- Players developing new skills (like big men shooting threes)
- Teams finding new ways to win

This evolution isn't stopping. Teams are still finding new ways to play the game, and what works today might be outdated tomorrow. The teams that succeed are usually the ones that see these changes coming and adapt before everyone else.
