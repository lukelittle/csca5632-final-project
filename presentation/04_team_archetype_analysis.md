# Finding Natural Team Styles

This is where things get really interesting. Using our measurements from the previous step, we let the computer find natural patterns in how teams play basketball. Instead of us deciding what makes teams different, we let the data tell us what patterns actually exist.

What we found was fascinating. There are three main "styles" of NBA basketball that keep showing up throughout history:

1. Modern Pace-and-Space Teams
These are the run-and-gun teams that shoot a lot of three-pointers. Think of the 2021 Brooklyn Nets or the 2022 Golden State Warriors. They:
- Take over 35% of their shots from three-point range
- Run more than 100 possessions per game
- Pass a lot (25+ assists per game)
- Spread the floor to create space

2. Traditional Inside-Out Teams
These are the old-school teams that control the paint. The 2004 Detroit Pistons and 2005 San Antonio Spurs are perfect examples. They:
- Score 40+ points in the paint
- Grab lots of offensive rebounds (10+ per game)
- Take 40% of their shots from mid-range
- Play a more physical style

3. Defensive Specialists
These teams win by stopping their opponents. The 2008 Boston Celtics and 2019 Toronto Raptors fit this mold. They:
- Keep opponents under 105 points per 100 possessions
- Shoot very efficiently (55%+ true shooting)
- Play at a slower pace (under 95 possessions)
- Excel at defensive fundamentals

But here's what's really cool - we also found some teams that changed basketball forever:

The 2015-16 Warriors revolutionized offense:
- Made 402 three-pointers when the league average was 186
- Changed how everyone thinks about shooting
- Made other teams copy their style

The 2003-04 Pistons showed defense wins championships:
- Had an incredible 92.5 defensive rating (league average: 102.9)
- Proved you don't need superstars to win
- Created a blueprint for defensive teams

The 1995-96 Bulls were perfect at everything:
- Elite on both offense and defense
- Set records that stood for decades
- Showed what a perfectly balanced team looks like

What's amazing is that these patterns explain about 65% of what makes teams different:
- 40% comes from offensive style (how they score)
- 25% comes from defensive approach (how they stop others)

We also found that successful teams usually do one of two things:
1. They perfect an existing style (like the Spurs with their system)
2. They create something new (like the Warriors with three-point shooting)

This tells us something important: there's no one "right way" to play basketball. Different styles can all be successful if they're executed well. It's not about copying what works for others - it's about finding your own style and mastering it.
