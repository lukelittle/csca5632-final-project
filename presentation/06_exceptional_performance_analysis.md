# Finding the Game Changers

After understanding how basketball has evolved, we wanted to find the teams that stood out from everyone else - the ones that didn't just play well, but changed how the game is played. We used special machine learning techniques to find performances that were truly exceptional.

Here's what we discovered about revolutionary teams:

The 2015-16 Warriors weren't just good, they were different:
- First team to make over 1,000 three-pointers in a season
- Scored 115.9 points per 100 possessions when league average was 106.4
- Changed what people thought was possible in basketball
- Set the 73-win record that broke the Bulls' famous mark
- Made other teams completely rethink their approach to defense

The 2003-04 Pistons broke the mold in another way:
- Held teams to 92.5 points per 100 possessions (league average: 102.9)
- Had 8 games where they held opponents under 70 points
- Won a championship without a superstar scorer
- Proved defense could still win in a scoring-focused league
- Created a blueprint that other teams tried to copy

The 1995-96 Bulls were exceptional by being great at everything:
- 114.5 offensive rating (best in the league)
- 101.8 defensive rating (best in the league)
- +12.7 net rating (highest ever at that point)
- 72-10 record that stood for 20 years
- Showed what a perfectly balanced team looks like

But we also found some interesting patterns about exceptional performances:

1. They Often Come in Clusters
- Great teams tend to stay great for several years
- The Warriors had five exceptional years in a row
- The Spurs had three different exceptional periods

2. They Change the League
- After the Warriors' success, three-point shooting exploded
- After the Pistons' defense, more teams focused on defensive specialists
- After the Bulls' two-way dominance, teams started emphasizing both offense and defense

3. They're Getting More Common
- In the 1990s, we found about 2-3 exceptional teams per season
- By the 2010s, we were seeing 4-5 exceptional teams each year
- This suggests teams are getting better at maximizing performance

4. They're Often Ahead of Their Time
- The D'Antoni Suns played like modern teams a decade early
- The 2011 Mavericks used spacing like teams do today
- The 2004 Pistons' switching defense is now common

What makes this analysis special is that we didn't just look for teams with good records. We found teams that were doing something fundamentally different from everyone else - teams that saw where basketball was going before anyone else did.

These teams show us that innovation in basketball isn't just about playing better - it's about playing differently. The teams that really change the game are the ones that find new ways to win, ways that other teams eventually have to copy or counter.
