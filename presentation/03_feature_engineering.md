# Creating Basketball DNA

Now that we have clean data, we need to turn it into meaningful measurements that can help us understand team patterns. Think of this like creating a team's DNA - we're looking at all the little pieces that make each team unique.

We created three main types of measurements:

First, we looked at Playing Style. This is about HOW teams play:
- How fast do they move up and down the court?
- Where do they like to shoot from?
- How much do they pass the ball?
- Do they prefer structured plays or freestyle basketball?

It's like looking at a team's personality - some teams are like sprinters, always running, while others are more like chess players, carefully planning each move.

Second, we looked at Team Composition. This is about WHO makes up the team:
- How experienced are the players?
- How often do they get injured?
- Do they keep the same players or change a lot?
- How deep is their bench?

This tells us about team stability and adaptability. Some teams are built around a solid core that stays together for years, while others constantly bring in new players.

Third, we looked at Performance Patterns. This is about WHAT HAPPENS when they play:
- How efficient are they on offense and defense?
- Do they play the same way every night, or do they vary a lot?
- What are their go-to strategies in different situations?
- How do they adjust when things aren't working?

This shows us how teams actually perform in games, beyond just wins and losses.

The really interesting part was seeing how these pieces fit together. We found that some combinations work better than others. For example, teams that play really fast need a deep bench because it's tiring. Teams that shoot a lot of three-pointers need good passing to create those shots.

We also discovered that successful teams usually excel in at least one of these areas. They might not be great at everything, but they have a clear identity - something they do really well that defines their style of play.

What makes this approach powerful is that we're not just looking at basic stats like points and rebounds. We're combining different pieces of information to understand deeper patterns. For instance, we can see how a team's style changes when key players are injured, or how their strategy evolves over a season.

This is like having a complete blueprint of how each team plays basketball. Now we can use these measurements to find natural groupings of teams and understand how basketball strategy has evolved over time.
