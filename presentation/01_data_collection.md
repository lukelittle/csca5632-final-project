# Gathering Our Data

In this part of the project, we went on a massive data collection effort to gather everything we need to understand NBA team patterns. Think of it like building the foundation of a house - we needed to make sure we had all the right materials before we could start building.

## What We Collected

We pulled together three huge datasets:

1. Shot Data (2004-2024)
   - Over 2.1 million shots
   - Every single shot taken in NBA games
   - Details like who took it, where they took it from, whether it went in
   - This helps us understand how teams approach offense

2. Injury Data (1951-2023)
   - 23,450 injury records
   - Every time a player got hurt or missed games
   - Information about what happened and how long they were out
   - This helps us understand how teams deal with player availability

3. Team Statistics (1951-2023)
   - 2,160 team seasons worth of data
   - All the standard basketball stats
   - Everything from points and rebounds to advanced metrics
   - This gives us the big picture of how teams performed

## How We Did It

We built an automated system to collect all this data from Kaggle, which is like a library for datasets. Here's what our system did:

1. Created an organized folder structure to store everything
2. Set up automatic downloading from Kaggle
3. Built progress tracking to make sure we got everything
4. Added error checking to catch any problems
5. Created detailed logs of what we downloaded

## What We Learned

During this process, we discovered some interesting things:
- The way NBA data is tracked has changed a lot over time
- Shot tracking became much more detailed after 2004
- Injury reporting has become more standardized recently
- Some teams changed names or moved cities, which we needed to account for

## Why This Matters

Having all this data in one place is crucial because:
- We can see the complete picture of how teams play
- We can track changes over many decades
- We can connect different aspects of the game (like how injuries affect shooting)
- We have enough data to find real patterns, not just random variation

## What's Next

With all this data collected and organized, we're ready to clean it up and make it consistent - which is the next step in our analysis. It's like having all the ingredients for a recipe; now we need to prepare them properly before we can start cooking.
