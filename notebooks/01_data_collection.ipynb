    "\n",
    "We're pulling together three massive datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shot Data (2004-2024)**\n",
    "   - Over 2.1 million shots\n",
    "   - Every single shot taken in NBA games\n",
    "   - Details like who took it, where they took it from, whether it went in\n",
    "   - This helps us understand how teams approach offense\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Injury Data (1951-2023)**\n",
    "   - 23,450 injury records\n",
    "   - Every time a player got hurt or missed games\n",
    "   - Information about what happened and how long they were out\n",
    "   - This helps us understand how teams deal with player availability\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Team Statistics (1951-2023)**\n",
    "   - 2,160 team seasons worth of data\n",
    "   - All the standard basketball stats\n",
    "   - Everything from points and rebounds to advanced metrics\n",
    "   - This gives us the big picture of how teams performed"
