    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores how NBA teams play basketball in fundamentally different ways. Instead of starting with predetermined categories or testing specific hypotheses, we're using unsupervised learning techniques to discover natural patterns in how teams approach the game. Think of it like letting the data tell us what kinds of teams exist, rather than deciding in advance what we expect to find.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis leverages three comprehensive datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [NBA Shots Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/nba-shots)\n",
    "  - Over 2.1M shots from 2004-2024\n",
    "  - Details on shot location, type, and outcome\n",
    "  - Reveals offensive strategy patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "* [NBA Injury Stats Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/loganlauton/nba-injury-stats-1951-2023)\n",
    "  - 23,450 injuries from 1951-2023\n",
    "  - Impact on team performance and adaptation\n",
    "  - Patterns in roster availability\n",
    "\n",
    "* [NBA/ABA/BAA Team Statistics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumitrodatta/nba-aba-baa-stats)\n",
    "  - 2,160 team-seasons of data\n",
    "  - Comprehensive performance metrics\n",
    "  - Historical trends and patterns"

    "## Analysis Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "We're using several machine learning techniques to let patterns emerge naturally from the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clustering Analysis**\n",
    "   * K-means clustering to identify distinct team \"styles\"\n",
    "   * Hierarchical clustering to map relationships between styles\n",
    "   * Reveals natural groupings without predetermined categories\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dimensionality Reduction**\n",
    "   * PCA to identify what aspects of the game matter most\n",
    "   * t-SNE to visualize team similarities and differences\n",
    "   * Helps understand complex relationships in the data\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Anomaly Detection**\n",
    "   * Isolation Forest to find truly unique performances\n",
    "   * Identifies revolutionary teams and strategies\n",
    "   * Reveals breakthrough moments in basketball evolution"

    "## Research Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Through these techniques, we aim to:\n",
    "* Discover what distinct styles of basketball naturally exist\n",
    "* Track how these styles have evolved over time\n",
    "* Understand what makes some teams revolutionary\n",
    "* Learn how injuries affect team strategies\n",
    "* Find patterns in successful approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes this approach special is that we're letting the patterns emerge from the data itself, rather than testing predetermined theories. It's like having a conversation with basketball history and letting it tell us what's interesting, rather than just confirming what we think we already know.\n",
    "\n",
    "This unsupervised learning approach provides deeper insights than traditional analysis because it can reveal patterns we might not have thought to look for. Instead of asking \"are these teams different?\", we're asking \"how are teams naturally different?\" - and the answers have been fascinating."
